# Crop Yield Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

Power BI dashboard analyzing crop yield performance and key agricultural factors.

## Objective
To understand how crop yield is influenced by rainfall, soil type, fertilizer usage, pesticide usage, humidity, temperature, irrigation method, and previous crop patterns.

## Tools
- Power BI
- Data Analysis & Visualization

## Key Analysis
- Crop-wise yield comparison (Rice, Wheat, Barley, Maize)
- Soil type impact (Loam, Sandy, Clay)
- Region-wise patterns (rainfall, temperature, humidity)
- Irrigation impact (Flood, Drip, Sprinkler, None)
- Previous crop influence (crop rotation analysis)

## Dataset
Dataset sourced from Kaggle (not included in this repository).
